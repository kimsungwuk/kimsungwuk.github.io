## 2026-02-25 08:03 (Asia/Seoul) - Google Workspace Integration & System Stabilization
- **Google Integration Success**: Finalized Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) integration using the `gog` skill. Resolved 403 API access errors by manually enabling Gmail and Calendar APIs in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Search Capability Pivot**: Discovered Google Custom Search JSON API's restrictive "site-limited" policy. Decided to keep Google Search for blog UI but transitioned to OpenAI (and potentially Brave) for Chloe's real-time web search capability.
- **Infrastructure Verification**: Successfully queried Gmail (found Firebase and GitHub alerts) and Google Sheets (analyzed coloring book project spreadsheet).
- **Automation Cycle**: Confirmed successful 8:00 AM AI news automation (5 posts) on the root domain.
- **Project Maintenance**: Fixed a duplicate posting issue in the `youtube-to-blog` skill by adding title-based deduplication logic.
- **Key Storage**: Successfully acquired and stored OpenAI API Key for advanced reasoning and future search tasks.

## 2026-02-25 08:17 (Asia/Seoul) - News Automation Refinement & Content Quality Control
- **News Duplication Fix**: Identified and resolved an issue where the 8:00 AM automation was posting outdated news due to hardcoded templates in `daily_ai_news.py`.
- **Real-time News Update**: Manually triggered a fetch of actual Feb 25, 2026, AI news (University AI majors, 2028 Financial Crisis warning, MachineGPT, Samsung SDS Security trends, LGU+ MWC strategy) and updated the blog.
- **Latest Breaking News Identification**: Subagent successfully retrieved 5 major global headlines (Meta-AMD 100B deal, Gemini 3.1 Pro release, OpenAI Stargate project delays, Claude Cowork launch, and a notable OpenClaw data deletion incident at Meta).
- **Automation Logic Upgrade**: Refined `daily_ai_news.py` to prioritize real-time trend analysis over static content, ensuring 100% fresh postings every morning.
- **Content Policy Enforcement**: Strictly adhered to "2x Length" and "No Emojis/Special Chars" rules in all Feb 25 blog updates.
