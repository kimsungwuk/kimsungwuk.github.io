- **Content Expansion Success**: All daily AI news posts were expanded to 2x+ length, incorporating deep journalistic analysis, future outlooks, and technical backgrounds as requested.
- **GitHub PAT Update**: Successfully updated the system's GitHub Personal Access Token using a newly regenerated key (`ghp_...`) after a 7-day expiration warning. Authenticated via `osxkeychain`.
- **New Post Addition**: Manually added a high-quality post regarding the "Naver Shopping AI Agent Beta Launch," focusing on HyperCLOVA X integration.
- **Verification & Deployment**: Manually triggered `build_engine.py` and verified that all 7 news articles for today (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Meta/AMD, Oura, Galaxy S26, Naver) are correctly formatted and pushed to `kimsungwuk.github.io`.
- **System Stability**: Confirmed that automation scripts (`daily_ai_news.py`) and deployment pipelines are fully functional with the new authentication credentials.
