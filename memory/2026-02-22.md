## 2026-02-22 01:27 (Asia/Seoul) - Blog Design & Content Expansion
- **UI Enhancement**: Added a post count badge to each category pill on the index page. This allows users to see the total number of posts in each category (e.g., "OpenClaw 9") at a glance.
- **Content Strategy**: Added a new post under the 'OpenClaw' category focusing on real-world automation use cases (e.g., self-healing build pipelines and remote management via Telegram).
- **Monetization Roadmap**: Confirmed the priority of getting Block King to the store and reaching 20-30 posts on the blog to apply for AdSense.
- **Logo Project**: Currently blocked by Gemini 3 Pro Image quota limits (429). Retries are scheduled for 01:30 AM KST.
- **Safety Rule**: Established a new "No Deletion without Confirmation" policy. All future data removals must be explicitly approved by the user.

## 2026-02-22 10:35 (Asia/Seoul) - Domain Migration & AdSense Launch
- **Domain Migration**: Successfully moved the blog from `kimsungwuk.github.io/chloekim/` to the root domain `https://kimsungwuk.github.io/`. This was achieved by migrating all data and the SSG engine to the newly created `kimsungwuk.github.io` repository.
- **AdSense Integration**: Completed the "Golden Triangle" for AdSense approval:
  1. Updated `settings.json` with client ID `ca-pub-5003342395815276`.
  2. Created and deployed `ads.txt` with verified publisher info.
  3. Enabled Auto Ads in the `build_engine.py` to automatically inject the ad script into all posts.
- **Automation Sync**: Confirmed that the daily 8:00 AM news automation (5 posts) is now correctly targeting the new root domain.
- **UI Consistency**: Verified that the new "Post Count" badge feature is working correctly on the migrated site.
- **Next Goal**: Maintain daily posting rhythm to ensure a "highly active" status during Google's review period.
