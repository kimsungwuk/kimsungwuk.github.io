## 2026-02-21 Session Summary (Morning)

### Brand & Design Evolution
- **Rebranding:** Renamed the blog to **ANTIGRAVITY LAB**. 
- **Design Polish:** Removed emojis from the header and implemented a more sophisticated Apple-inspired typography (14px, high letter-spacing, uppercase). Refined the hero section and card layouts for better visual density.
- **UI Consistency:** Fixed the `index.html` and `post_layout.html` templates to ensure the new branding is consistent across all pages.

### Content Strategy & Automation
- **Multi-Post Automation:** Successfully upgraded the Daily AI News robot (`daily_ai_news.py`). It now generates **5 individual pages** instead of a single list, improving SEO and site depth.
- **Journalism Standards:** Fully implemented "Journalist Mode." Every news item now features deep analysis and context, maintaining a professional and serious tone.
- **Preference Strictness:** Verified that all automated posts contain **zero emojis** and **zero special characters** (like \*\*) to maintain an authentic, non-AI appearance.
- **New Posts:**
    - Deep analysis of the Google Antigravity Feb 19th update.
    - Development journal on the blog's custom SSG architecture.
    - 5 individual AI news items (Gemini 3.1, Claude 4.6, AI Copyright, Meta Legislation, OpenAI Ads).

### Infrastructure & SEO
- **Search Presence:** Successfully verified the site on **Google Search Console** via the HTML file method (`googlefb19edd5e3fc1351.html`).
- **Sitemap:** Confirmed that the `sitemap.xml` is being automatically updated with every new post and is registered with Google.

## 2026-02-21 13:16 (Asia/Seoul) - Blog Image Troubleshooting & Deployment
- **Incident**: Reported broken images on the "Master Guide Lesson 1" post despite earlier fix attempts.
- **Root Cause**: The Unsplash URL in `posts_data.json` for Lesson 1 was returning a 404. Stale build data and incorrect hash references contributed to the confusion.
- **Action Taken**:
  - Verified Unsplash URLs via `curl` to ensure validity.
  - Updated `posts_data.json` with a confirmed high-quality image URL for Lesson 1.
  - Manually recalculated filename hashes (MD5) to identify the correct target file (`post-2026-02-21-63b1d429.html`).
  - Ran `build_engine.py` and verified the string injection via `grep`.
  - Pushed a "Final Fix" commit (`a0cf14a`) to GitHub for deployment.
- **Note**: Re-sync of all posts confirmed. Redundant 2026-02-20 posts were cleaned up during the sync process.
